    If you installed Larafast via Larafast Installer, you don't need this step. Installer already did it for you.

It's important to keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository. This ensures that your fork has the latest changes and features. This guide will show you how to keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository.

## Fork the repository

To fork the repository, click "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository page.

## Clone your fork

```bash
git clone git@github.com:[your-fork-name].git
```

<Tip>
    Follow the instructions in [VILT Stack](/intro-vilt) or [TALL Stack](/intro-tall) for initial setup of your project.
</Tip>

## Add the original repository as a remote

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:karakhanyans-tools/larafast.git
```

For TALL stack:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:karakhanyans-tools/larafast-tall.git
```

For Directories:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:karakhanyans-tools/larafast-directories.git
```

For API:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:karakhanyans-tools/larafast-rest-api.git
```

## Fetch the latest changes from the original repository

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

## Merge the changes from the original repository

```bash
git merge upstream/master
```

If you see some conflicts, resolve them manually and then commit the changes.

## Push the changes to your fork

```bash
git push origin master
```

That's it. Your fork is now up-to-date with the original repository.
