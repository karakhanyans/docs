## Overview

Larafast Multi-Tenancy includes a **built-in team member management interface**. Team owners can view all members, invite new ones, and manage existing memberships - all through the pre-built UI.

## Viewing Team Members

The team members interface is already available in your application:

- **Navigation**: Click "Users" or "Team Members" in the sidebar
- **Location**: `app/Filament/App/Resources/UserResource.php`
- **Access**: All team members can view the list

### What You'll See

The team members table displays:
- **Name** - Member's full name
- **Email** - Email address (with copy button)
- **Owner Badge** - Shows who owns the team
- **Join Date** - When the member joined
- **Actions** - Remove member button (for owners only)

The list automatically shows only members of your current team. When you switch teams, the member list updates automatically.

## Adding New Members

To add someone to your team, you use the **invitation system** (already built-in):

1. **Click "Invite Member"** button at the top of the members page
2. **Enter their email** and select their role
3. **Send invitation** - They receive an email with an invitation link
4. **They accept** - Once they click the link and accept, they're automatically added to your team

See [Sending Invitations](/multi-tenancy/invitations/sending-invitations) for details on how the invitation system works.

## Removing Members

Team owners can remove members from the team:

1. **Find the member** in the team members list
2. **Click the trash icon** next to their name
3. **Confirm removal** in the dialog
4. **Member removed** - They lose access to the team immediately

**Important Notes:**
- ✅ Only team owners can remove members
- ❌ You cannot remove the team owner
- ✅ Removed members can be re-invited if needed
- ✅ Removing a member doesn't delete their user account

## Team Ownership

### Who is the Owner?

The team owner is the user who created the team. Owners have special privileges:
- Can invite and remove members
- Can edit team settings
- Can delete the team
- Cannot be removed from the team

In the members list, the owner is clearly marked with an "Owner" badge.

### Transferring Ownership

If you need to transfer team ownership to another member, this can be done through the admin panel or by customizing the team settings page.

**Location:** Admin Panel → Teams → Select Team → Change Owner

## Member Roles

When inviting members, you can assign roles that determine their permissions:
- **Admin** - Full access to manage the team
- **Editor** - Can create and edit content
- **Viewer** - Read-only access

Roles are managed through Laravel's Spatie Permission package, which is already integrated into the application.

## Team Switcher

Members who belong to multiple teams can easily switch between them:

1. **Click the team name** in the top navigation bar
2. **Select a different team** from the dropdown
3. **Automatic switch** - The interface updates to show the new team's data

This feature is built-in and requires no configuration.

## Viewing Member Activity

The system tracks when members join teams and can log member activities using the built-in activity log feature.

To see team activities:
- **Location**: Admin Panel → Activity Logs
- **Filter**: By team or user
- **Shows**: Invitations sent, members added/removed, team changes

## Customization

### Customizing the Members Table

If you want to show additional information about members (e.g., their role, last login), you can customize the UserResource:

**Location:** `app/Filament/App/Resources/UserResource.php`

The table uses Filament's table builder, so you can add columns, filters, and actions easily.

### Adding Member Permissions

To control what members can do based on their role, you can use policies and gates:

**Location:** `app/Policies/TeamPolicy.php`

The policy system is already set up with Laravel's authorization features.
