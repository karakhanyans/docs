## Overview

Larafast Multi-Tenancy comes with a **built-in team creation system**. Users are automatically prompted to create their first team when they log in for the first time. No additional setup is required - everything is already configured and ready to use.

## How It Works

### First-Time User Experience

1. **User registers/logs in** - New user creates an account or logs in
2. **Automatic redirect** - If the user has no teams, they're automatically redirected to the team creation page
3. **Create team** - User fills in team name and description (optional)
4. **Instant access** - Team is created, user becomes the owner, and gains immediate access to the application

### Team Creation Form

The team creation page includes:
- **Team Name** (required) - The name of the team/organization
- **Description** (optional) - A brief description of the team's purpose

### What Happens Automatically

When a user creates a team, the system automatically:
1. ✅ Creates the team record in the database
2. ✅ Sets the user as the team owner
3. ✅ Adds the user as a team member
4. ✅ Sets this team as the user's current/active team
5. ✅ Redirects to the team dashboard

## Team Creation Page

The team creation interface is already built and located at:
- **File**: `app/Filament/App/Pages/Tenancy/RegisterTeam.php`
- **URL**: Automatically shown when needed (no direct URL access)

You can customize this page to add additional fields or change the styling to match your brand.

## Multiple Teams

Users can create multiple teams:

1. Click on the current team name in the top navigation
2. Select "New team" from the dropdown
3. Fill in the team information
4. Start using the new team immediately

The system supports unlimited teams per user, and users can easily switch between their teams using the tenant switcher in the navigation bar.

## Customization

### Adding Custom Fields

If you want to collect additional information during team creation (e.g., company size, industry), you can edit the `RegisterTeam.php` file and add more form fields:

**Location:** `app/Filament/App/Pages/Tenancy/RegisterTeam.php`

The form uses Filament's form builder, so you can add any field types (text inputs, selects, file uploads, etc.).

### Disabling Team Creation

If you want to control team creation (e.g., only admins can create teams), you can disable the registration page in the panel configuration:

**Location:** `app/Providers/Filament/AppPanelProvider.php`

Simply remove or comment out this line:
```php
// ->tenantRegistration(RegisterTeam::class)
```

This will prevent users from creating their own teams. You would then need to create teams programmatically or through an admin interface.

## Admin Team Management

Administrators can view and manage all teams in the system through the Admin Panel:
- **URL**: `/admin/teams`
- **Access**: Requires admin role

From here, admins can:
- View all teams across the system
- Create teams for users
- Edit team information
- Delete teams
- Manage team members
