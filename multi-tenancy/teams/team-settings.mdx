Team owners can access settings in two ways:

1. **User Menu** - Click your avatar â†’ "Team Settings" or "Team Profile"
2. **Direct URL** - Navigate to `/app/teams/{team-id}/edit`

## What's Included

The team settings page displays:

### Team Information
- **Team Name** - Editable

## Customization

The team settings page can be customized to add your own fields:

**Location:** `app/Filament/App/Pages/Tenancy/EditTeamProfile.php`

You can add fields like:
- Team logo/avatar
- Website URL
- Company size
- Industry
