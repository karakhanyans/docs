## Overview

Larafast Multi-Tenancy comes with **team-based subscription billing** built right in. Each team can have its own subscription, allowing you to charge per team/organization rather than per user - the standard SaaS pricing model.

## How Team Subscriptions Work

### Team-Level Billing

Unlike user-based billing where each individual pays, **team subscriptions** mean:

- ‚úÖ **One subscription per team** - The team pays, not individual members
- ‚úÖ **Unlimited team members** - Add as many users as you want (or set your own limits)
- ‚úÖ **Team owner pays** - The person who created the team manages the subscription
- ‚úÖ **Automatic access control** - Only subscribed teams can access premium features

### Pricing Model

**Example:** A project management SaaS
- **Free Plan**: 3 projects, 5 team members
- **Starter Plan**: $29/month - 50 projects, unlimited members
- **Pro Plan**: $99/month - Unlimited projects, priority support

**How it works:**
- Acme Corp creates a team and subscribes to the Starter Plan
- They pay $29/month total (not per user!)
- They can add 10, 20, or 100 team members - same price
- If they need more projects, they upgrade to Pro
- Each team has its own independent subscription

'stripe' => [
    [
        'name' => 'Free',
        'slug' => 'free',
        'description' => 'Perfect for small teams getting started',
        'price' => 0,
        'interval' => 'month',
        'features' => [
            'Up to 3 projects',
            'Basic features',
            '5 team members',
            'Email support',
        ],
    ],
    [
        'name' => 'Starter',
        'slug' => 'starter',  // Must match Stripe Price ID
        'description' => 'For growing teams',
        'price' => '29.99',
        'interval' => 'month',
        'features' => [
            'Everything in Free',
            'Unlimited projects',
            'Unlimited team members',
            'Advanced features',
            'Priority support',
        ],
        'bestseller' => true,  // Shows "Most Popular" badge
    ],
    [
        'name' => 'Pro',
        'slug' => 'pro',  // Must match Stripe Price ID
        'description' => 'For large organizations',
        'price' => '99.99',
        'interval' => 'month',
        'features' => [
            'Everything in Starter',
            'Custom integrations',
            'Dedicated account manager',
            'SLA guarantee',
            'Phone support',
        ],
    ],
],
```

## Subscription Flow

### 1. Team Creation
User creates a team ‚Üí Starts on Free plan (or trial)

### 2. Upgrade Decision
Team owner clicks "Upgrade" or accesses premium features

### 3. Payment Page
Redirected to Stripe checkout with team context

### 4. Subscription Active
Payment successful ‚Üí Team immediately has premium access

### 5. Team Members Benefit
All team members automatically get premium features

### 6. Renewal
Stripe handles automatic billing monthly/yearly

## Access Control

The system automatically checks if teams have active subscriptions:

```php
// In your routes or middleware
->middleware(['subscribed']) // Requires active subscription
```

**What happens:**
- ‚úÖ **Subscribed teams**: Full access
- ‚ùå **No subscription**: Redirected to billing page
- ‚è∞ **Trial expired**: Prompted to subscribe
- üí≥ **Payment failed**: Grace period, then restricted

## Subscription Management

Team owners can manage their subscription:

### Billing Portal
- **Access**: User menu ‚Üí "Billing" or automatic redirect
- **Actions**: Update payment method, view invoices, change plan, cancel

### What Team Owners Can Do
- View current plan and next billing date
- Update credit card information
- Upgrade or downgrade plans
- View payment history and invoices
- Cancel subscription (with confirmation)
- Resume canceled subscription (before period ends)

### What Happens on Cancellation
- **Immediate**: No - access continues until period ends
- **Grace period**: Team keeps access until billing cycle ends
- **After expiration**: Team loses premium features, redirected to billing
- **Data retention**: All team data is preserved

## Admin Subscription Management

Administrators can view and manage all subscriptions:

**Location:** Admin Panel ‚Üí Stripe Subscriptions

- View all subscribed teams
- See revenue metrics
- Monitor failed payments
- Manually cancel or modify subscriptions
- View subscription analytics

## Webhook Configuration

Stripe sends webhooks for subscription events:
- Subscription created/updated/canceled
- Payment succeeded/failed
- Invoice paid
- Customer updated

These are automatically handled by Laravel Cashier - no additional code needed!

**Webhook URL:** `https://yourapp.com/stripe/webhook`
