## Overview

Larafast Multi-Tenancy includes a **complete invitation system** that's ready to use out of the box. Team owners can invite new members via email, and the system handles everything automatically - from sending emails to adding members when they accept.

## How to Invite Someone

### From the Team Members Page

1. **Navigate to Team Members** - Click "Users" or "Team Members" in the sidebar
2. **Click "Invite Member"** - Button located at the top of the page
3. **Fill in the form**:
   - **Email** - The person's email address
   - **Role** - Select their permission level (Admin, Editor, or Viewer)
4. **Click "Send Invitation"** - The system sends the email immediately

That's it! The invitation is created and the email is sent automatically.

## What Happens When You Send an Invitation

The system automatically:

1. ✅ **Creates an invitation record** - Stored securely in the database
2. ✅ **Generates a unique token** - 64-character secure token for the invitation link
3. ✅ **Sets expiration date** - Invitation expires after 7 days
4. ✅ **Sends email** - Queued job sends the invitation email
5. ✅ **Tracks status** - Monitors if invitation is pending, accepted, or expired

## The Invitation Email

Recipients receive a professional email that includes:

- **Team name** - Which team they're invited to join
- **Sender's name** - Who invited them
- **Role** - What permissions they'll have
- **Accept button** - Clear call-to-action link
- **Expiration date** - When the invitation expires

**Email Template Location:** `resources/views/emails/team-invitation.blade.php`

You can customize this template to match your brand or add additional information.

## Invitation Expiration

Invitations are valid for **7 days** by default. After that:
- The invitation link no longer works
- The invitation shows as "Expired" in your dashboard
- You can resend a new invitation if needed

### Why Invitations Expire

Security best practice - expired tokens can't be used maliciously, and it encourages invitees to join promptly.

## Managing Pending Invitations

You can view and manage all your team's invitations:

### Pending Invitations Widget

If enabled, the dashboard shows a widget with:
- **Email** - Who was invited
- **Role** - What role they'll get
- **Status** - Pending, Accepted, or Expired
- **Expires** - When the invitation expires
- **Actions** - Resend or delete

### Resending an Invitation

If someone didn't receive the email or it expired:

1. **Find the invitation** in the pending invitations list
2. **Click "Resend"** - Extends expiration by 7 days and sends a new email
3. **Done** - They receive a fresh invitation

### Canceling an Invitation

To cancel an invitation before it's accepted:

1. **Find the invitation** in the list
2. **Click the delete/trash icon**
3. **Confirm** - The invitation link becomes invalid

## Invitation Validation

The system automatically validates:
- ✅ **Email format** - Must be a valid email address
- ✅ **Duplicate check** - Can't invite someone who's already a member
- ✅ **Pending check** - Can't send duplicate pending invitations
- ✅ **Expiration** - Links don't work after expiration

## Email Configuration

For invitations to work, you need to configure email in your `.env` file:

```bash
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io  # Your SMTP host
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

The system uses **queued emails**, so invitations are sent in the background without slowing down your application.

## Customization

### Changing Expiration Time

To change how long invitations are valid:

**Location:** `app/Filament/App/Resources/UserResource/Pages/ListUsers.php`

Find the `expires_at` field and change `addDays(7)` to your preferred duration:
```php
'expires_at' => now()->addDays(14), // 14 days instead of 7
```

### Customizing Invitation Roles

To add, remove, or rename roles:

**Location:** Same file as above, in the invite form

Modify the `role` select options:
```php
Forms\Components\Select::make('role')
    ->options([
        'owner' => 'Owner',        // Add new role
        'admin' => 'Administrator', // Rename
        'member' => 'Member',      // Add new role
    ])
```

### Customizing the Email

**Location:** `resources/views/emails/team-invitation.blade.php`

This is a Laravel Markdown email template. You can modify the text, add your logo, change colors, or add additional information.
