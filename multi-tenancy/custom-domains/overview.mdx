## What are Custom Domains?

Custom domains in **Larafast Multi-Tenancy** allow each team (tenant) to access their workspace through their own branded domain instead of a shared application domain. This feature is essential for white-label SaaS applications where customers want their own identity and branding.

## Why Use Custom Domains?

### Professional Branding
Instead of accessing your application at `app.yourapp.com/team/acme`, teams can use their own domain like `app.acme.com` or `portal.acme.com`, providing a professional, branded experience.

### White-Label Solutions
Perfect for agencies and businesses that want to offer your platform under their own brand without any visible connection to your main application.

### SEO Benefits
Custom domains help teams maintain their own domain authority and search engine rankings rather than contributing to your shared domain.

### Trust and Credibility
Customers often trust applications more when they can access them through their own verified domain with SSL certificates.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Agency Portals**
Marketing agencies can provide each client with their own branded portal:
- `portal.clienta.com` for Client A
- `dashboard.clientb.com` for Client B
- Each client sees only their branding and domain

### 2. **Multi-Brand Businesses**
Companies managing multiple brands can give each brand its own domain:
- `admin.brandx.com` for Brand X management
- `portal.brandy.com` for Brand Y operations

### 3. **Franchise Management**
Franchisors can provide each franchisee with their own management portal:
- `manage.franchise-location1.com`
- `manage.franchise-location2.com`

### 4. **Education Platforms**
Educational institutions can have their own learning portals:
- `lms.university-a.edu`
- `courses.school-b.edu`

### 5. **Customer Success Portals**
B2B companies can provide each enterprise customer with a dedicated portal:
- `support.enterprise-a.com`
- `hub.enterprise-b.com`

## How It Works

The custom domains feature in Larafast Multi-Tenancy provides a complete automated workflow:

### 1. Domain Configuration
Team owners can configure their custom domain through the team settings panel in your Filament admin interface.

### 2. DNS Verification
The system automatically verifies that the domain's DNS records are properly configured to point to your application's server.

### 3. Site Provisioning
Once DNS is verified, the system automatically creates a new site on your Laravel Forge server using the Forge API.

### 4. SSL Certificate Generation
The system automatically provisions a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate using DigitalOcean DNS validation, ensuring secure HTTPS connections.

### 5. Certificate Activation
Once the certificate is issued, it's automatically activated on the Forge site, making the custom domain fully operational.

## Architecture

The custom domains feature is built with a robust event-driven architecture:

### Models
- **Team Model**: Stores the primary domain information (`domain`, `domain_verified`, `forge_site_id`, `forge_certificate_id`)
- **Domain Model**: Tracks detailed domain information including DNS verification status, SSL installation status, and history

### Events & Listeners
- **DnsVerified Event**: Fired when DNS records are successfully verified
- **ForgeSiteCreated Event**: Fired when a Forge site is created
- **CreateForgeSite Listener**: Listens for DNS verification and triggers site creation
- **CreateForgeSiteCertificate Listener**: Listens for site creation and triggers SSL certificate provisioning

### Background Jobs
- **VerifyDomainDnsRecordsJob**: Checks if DNS records are properly configured
- **CreateForgeSiteJob**: Creates a new site on Laravel Forge
- **CreateForgeSiteCertificateJob**: Provisions and activates SSL certificates

### Services
- **ForgeService**: Handles all Laravel Forge API interactions including site management, SSL certificates, and Nginx configuration

### Console Commands
- **CheckCustomDomainSetup**: Runs periodically (via scheduler) to monitor and complete pending domain setups

## Requirements

To use the custom domains feature, you need:

1. **Laravel Forge Account** - For automated server and site management
2. **DigitalOcean Account** - For DNS validation during SSL certificate provisioning
3. **Configured Server** - A Laravel Forge server where sites will be created
4. **Queue Worker** - Running to process background jobs
5. **Scheduler** - Running to check domain setup status periodically

## Security Considerations

### DNS Verification
Before creating sites or certificates, the system verifies that teams actually own the domains they're configuring by checking DNS records.

### SSL/TLS Encryption
All custom domains automatically receive Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, ensuring secure communications.

### Isolation
Each team's custom domain is isolated at the Forge site level, with separate Nginx configurations and certificates.

### Rate Limiting
The system includes retry logic and limits to prevent abuse of the Forge API and Let's Encrypt certificate limits.
