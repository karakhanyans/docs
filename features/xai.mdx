Larafast provides a simple way to integrate xAI API with Laravel.

## Installation

1. Create an account on [xAI](https://accounts.x.ai/account)
2. Create your API key from the dashboard from [API Keys](https://accounts.x.ai/api-keys)
3. Add your API key to your `.env` file as `XAI_KEY=your-api-key`

That's it, your project is ready to use xAI API.

## Usage

To use xAI service, you can create an instance of `XAIService` and use the following methods to interact with xAI API.

### For text completion
```php
use App\Services\XAIService;

Route::get('/xai', function (XAIService $xai) {
    return $xai->completion('Hello, how are you?');
});

or

```php
$xai = app(XAIService::class);
$xai->completion('Hello, how are you?');
```
