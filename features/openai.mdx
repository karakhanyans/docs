Larafast provides a simple way to integrate OpenAI API with Laravel.

## Installation

1. Create an account on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
2. Create your API key from the dashboard from [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Add your API key to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_KEY=your-api-key`

That's it, your project is ready to use OpenAI API.

## Usage

To use OpenAI API completion, you can use the instance of `OpenAIService`.

```php
use App\Services\OpenAIService;

$openai = app(OpenAIService::class);
$response = $openai->completion('Write recipe based on the given ingredients: 1 cup of flour, 2 eggs, 1 cup of sugar');

// You can also pass the model name
$response = $openai->completion('Write recipe based on the given ingredients: 1 cup of flour, 2 eggs, 1 cup of sugar', 'davinci');

// See the list of pre-defined model names in config/services.php -> openai.models

// To get the response
echo $response['choices'][0]['message']['content'];
```

To create images using OpenAI API, you can use:

```php
use App\Services\OpenAIService;

$openai = app(OpenAIService::class);
$response = $openai->image('A beautiful sunset over the mountains');
```

You can adjust the number of generating images and the size in the OpenAIService@image method.

To create an audio from text using OpenAI API, you can use:

```php
use App\Services\OpenAIService;

$openai = app(OpenAIService::class);
$response = $openai->textToSpeech('Hello, how are you?');
```

<Warning>
    The text-to-speech will return the audio content instead of the URL as for the image. You can save the audio content to a file or return it as a response.
</Warning>

For more information, you can check the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) to add new features to your service or adjust existing ones.
