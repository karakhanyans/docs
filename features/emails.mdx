Emails are sent using Laravel's built-in Mail functionality, which supports various mailers including SMTP, Mailgun, Postmark, Amazon SES, Resend, and more. To get started, configure your mail settings in the `.env` file.

Larafast uses [Resend](https://resend.com) as our default email provider.

## Configuration

```env
MAIL_MAILER=resend
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="sergey@phlaunches.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
RESEND_API_KEY=re_nKMWy5on_JS3lkjnkjFPhuCQgYN7rJgtVmac9aS
```

## Notifications

Larafast comes with 6 transactional notifications:
